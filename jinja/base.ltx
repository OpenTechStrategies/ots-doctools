\section{What is Lorem Ipsum?}

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

\subsection{Why do we use it?}

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it
look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

\subsection{Where does it come from?}

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going
through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line
of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced
below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de
Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
translation by H. Rackham.

\subsection{Where can I get some?}

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but
the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected
humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need
to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of
text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator
on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words,
combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate
Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is
therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
non-characteristic words etc.  Try https://lipsum.com/
