% This allows urls to linebreak in footnotes.  It uses the above replace routine.

% Use this for including source references that you don't want to
% include in the output, for example the unique codes used by
% `ots-set-ref' and `ots-find-ref' from ${OTSDIR}/utils/ots.el.
%
% This is just to quickly preserve traceability while writing; later,
% we might convert some of these references to reader-visible form,
% but that would usually also involve first making an appendix
% containing the relevant interview notes (which would therefore need
% to be scrubbed for confidentiality) and having a citation format.
% None of that is handled by this command.  All this command does is
% enable us to keep track of where a piece of information came from,
% with a minimum of interference to the flow of writing process.
%
% (See also the setting of `ots-ref-root' at the bottom of the .ltx
% file under "Local Variables", which makes `ots-find-ref' work here.)
\newcommand{\otsref}[1]{}

% Use one or the other version of this command for citations to other
% documents.  The \otsciteid variant is for citations involving some
% kind of unique identifier (e.g., like for the document inventory in
% ../../clients/hhs/cms/psm/approaches/deliverables/psm-approaches.ltx).
%
% Note: I thought that LaTeX supported command overloading, so that
% one could just distinguish between two versions of \otscite based on
% the number of arguments supplied.  But apparently that doesn't work,
% so the other one is \otsciteid.
\newcommand{\otscite}[1]{\emph{``#1''}}
\newcommand{\otsciteid}[2]{\emph{``#1'' (#2)}}

% Use this for the first mention of a thing.

% Use this for foreign (e.g., Latin) phrases.

% Use this to create a paragraph with wide left and right margins,
