% Just some branding stuff
\newcommand{\otslogoicon}{\raisebox{2em}{\includegraphics[clip,
trim=0cm 11cm 19.3cm 11cm, scale=0.09]{otslogo.pdf}}}
% The renewcommand below, if uncommented, causes itemized lists to
% have little OTS logos for bullet points.  After a while of reading a
% document in that style, Karl found the list items a bit harder to
% find visually than they are with regular bullet points, and had some
% branding concerns about it as well: basically, worried that it might
% strike clients as a little too pushy.  Up for discussion, of course.

\renewcommand{\footnoterule}{\textcolor{dkgreen}{\rule{\textwidth}{0.9pt}}\vspace*{0.6ex}}

% We generally use \otsurl (which see) instead of \url.  However, we
% make the 'url' package available just in case anyone wants it.

\usepackage{censor}

% Use this to shrink the vertical space between lines in a ToC,
% for example because your ToC *almost* fits all on the first
% page and with a little shrinking you can make it work.  E.g.:
%
%   \begin{spacing}{0.1}
%   \tableofcontents
%   \end{spacing}
%
% You can also use this for things like double-spacing a document, etc.
% More information at https://latex.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4628 and
% https://ctan.org/pkg/setspace and especially the "Usage:" section of
% http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/setspace/setspace.sty.
\usepackage{setspace}

% This is so we can do
%
%  \begin{adjustwidth}{LEFT_AMOUNT}{RIGHT_AMOUNT}
%  ...your text here...
%  \end{adjustwidth}
%
% For example, if LEFT_AMOUNT is "0.5in" then it will add 0.5 inches
% to the left-side margin.
%
% An alternative would be to do this in the preamble...
%
%   \def\changemargin#1#2{\list{}{\rightmargin#2\leftmargin#1}\item[]}
%   \let\endchangemargin=\endlist
%
% ...and then in the text:
%
%   \begin{changemargin}{<arg>}{<arg>}
%   \end{changemargin}
%
% See https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/588/\

% See "An Acronym Environment for LaTeX 2e", by Tobias Oetiker:
% http://ctan.mirrors.hoobly.com/macros/latex/contrib/acronym/acronym.pdf
%
% Acronyms should be expanded on first use, but not after.
%
% Research note:
% --------------
%
% In case you're wondering why the "acronym" package versus, say, the
% "acro" package, % which is very similar, it happens that Karl went
% down this research road (because reasons, yak-shaving, etc) and
% his tentative conclusion is that "acronym" is the most popular one,
% and that even the author of "acro" doesn't necessarily think you
% should switch from "acronym" to "acro" unless you really need to.
% Specifically, see this in the source of "acro" (in acro_en.tex):
%
%   > After \wikipedia{} told us what acronyms are and we won't confuse them
%   > with units or other kinds of abbreviations -- why would we need
%   > another package for them?  There are several already:
%   > \pkg{acronym}~\cite{pkg:acronym}, \pkg{acromake}~\cite{pkg:acromake},
%   > \pkg{acroterm}~\cite{pkg:acroterm}, the abbreviations package
%   > \pkg{abbrevs}~\cite{pkg:abbrevs} (the current version 1.4 has a
%   > bug\footnote{see \url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/59840/5049}
%   > for solutions.}, though), the nomenclature package
%   > \pkg{nomencl}~\cite{pkg:nomencl}, and of course the mighty
%   > \pkg{glossaries}~\cite{pkg:glossaries}. So there is really no
%   > \emph{need} for a new package.
%   >
%   > On the other hand \pkg{acronym}, the best of the acronym specific
%   > packages, has one or two shortcomings and sometimes using
%   > \pkg{glossaries} seems a bit of an overkill (or simply inconvenient as
%   > one has to run \code{makeglossaries}, \code{makeindex} or
%   > \code{xindy}, then\footnote{Rumour has it there is going to be a
%   > version that can be used without running an external program}). So
%   > \acro\ stands somewhere in between (but closer to \pkg{acronym}).
%   >
%   > The main reason for the existance of \acro\ is a question on
%   > \acs{tex.sx}
%   > \footnote{\url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/59449/5049}} which
%   > intrigued me and in consequence led to \acro\ and it's option
%   > \option{single}.
%   >
%   > \acro\ has many similarities with the \pkg{acronym} package.  In fact,
%   > quite some macros have the same name and meaning\footnote{\emph{Not}
%   > in the sense of \cs*{meaning}!}.
%   >
%   > Please take a minute to think and decide which package will suit your
%   > needs best.  Are you planning to add a glossary to your book?  You
%   > should probably go with \pkg{glossaries}, then.  Are you planning to
%   > add a nomenclature?  You may want to choose \pkg{nomencl} (or again:
%   > \pkg{glossaries}) and so on.  \acro\ does a good job for lists of
%   > abbreviations.

% Use this for including source references that you don't want to
% include in the output, for example the unique codes used by
% `ots-set-ref' and `ots-find-ref' from ${OTS_DIR}/utils/ots.el.
%
% This is just to quickly preserve traceability while writing; later,
% we might convert some of these references to reader-visible form,
% but that would usually also involve first making an appendix
% containing the relevant interview notes (which would therefore need
% to be scrubbed for confidentiality) and having a citation format.
% None of that is handled by this command.  All this command does is
% enable us to keep track of where a piece of information came from,
% with a minimum of interference to the flow of writing process.
%
% (See also the setting of `ots-ref-root' at the bottom of the .ltx
% file under "Local Variables", which makes `ots-find-ref' work here.)
\newcommand{\otsref}[1]{}

% I love this so much.  Here's what's going on:
%
% Sometimes you want an enumerated list where the separator after the
% number is a single right parenthesis instead of a dot.  Like this:
%
%   1) item one
%   2) item two
%   3) item three
%
% ...and so on.  This can easily be accomplished in LaTeX like this:
%
%   \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
%
% But what if you want to refer to specific list items by label,
% that is, using references instead of just hardcoding numbers?
%
% Setting up the labels is the easy part:
%
%   \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
%     \item\label{fish} This is item one, internally labeled "fish".
%     \item\label{sock} This is item two, internally labeled "sock".
%   \end{enumerate}
%
% But that means "\ref{sock}" will produce "2)" instead of "(2)".  You
% could write "(\ref{sock}", but I trust I don't need to explain why
% that's not a pleasant thing to see in one's LaTeX source.
%
% Hence this new command.  The single left paren is still there, but
% at least it's isolated to the command definition so you won't see it
% when working with the LaTeX source text.
\newcommand{\otsparenref}[1]{(\ref{#1}}

% Create an indented, italicized, parenthesized green note.
%
% This comes in both command form ("\otsindentednote") and environment
% form ("\begin{otsindentednoteenv}...\end{otsindentednoteenv}"),
% because sometimes you want to drop a brief note into the doc and
% sometimes you want to write multi-paragraph note.  Sorry about the
% "env" suffix on the environment name; LaTeX namespacing FTW yay.
%
% By the way, https://htmlcolorcodes.com/colors/shades-of-green/ tells
% us that #4F7942 == "Fern Green".
%
% Internal OTS note: We had some similar commands way back when, in
% some of the reports we wrote for the PSM project.  Nowadays that's
% all archived in SVN and is no longer in HEAD.  To see them, do:
%
%   $ svn checkout https://.../clients/hhs/cms/@r13321
%   $ cd cms
%   $ find . -name "*.ltx" -print
%
% The LaTeX commands in question are:
%
%   - \vtbd    (in psm-approaches.ltx and psc-gap-analysis.ltx)
%   - \otswarn (in psm-approaches.ltx)
%
% Also, there are a number of other interesting LaTeX commands there
% that we might want to revive some day, like \otscaption, \otshref,
% \iitem, \specialcell, \filespec, and \otsfirstterm.

%
% Note: I thought that LaTeX supported command overloading, so that

% the number of arguments supplied.  But apparently that doesn't work,
% so the other one is \otsciteid.
